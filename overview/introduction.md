# Introduction to the Admin Panel

## What is the TeacherSeat Adminstrative Panel?

A **panel** is a web-application that represents a workspace for specific types of users within the TeacherSeat learning platform. A panel can also be referred to as a *console* or a *portal*.

The TeacherSeat platform is composed of two main panels:

1. The Student Panel — A web-application where students carry out studying
2. The Admin Panel — A web-application where administrators (admins) manage the various systems, content and users

When your TeacherSeat learning platform is provisioned and you log-in for the first time, you are accessing the Admin Panel.

From the Admin Panel you can perform various actions such as:
- install and register various systems and subsystems
- access and manager various TeacherSeat resources eg. users, materials, plans
- views analaytics of your other administrators
- view students progression through the provided learning materials

When users sign up to your learning platform, they are signing up as students and therefore will only have access to the Student Panel. Students generally do not have access to your Admin Panel but it is possible to configure a user to have both student and adminstrator panel access.

## Logging into the Admin Panel

Students and Administrators use the same login page to access the admin panel. eg. `https://demo.teacherseat.com/login`

When both a Student and Administrator login they will always first be brought to the student panel.
If a user is an Adminstrator, they will see in the **User Dropdown** a link to Admin, when they click on that link they will be redirected to the Admin Homepage Dashboard.

## Admin Homepage Dashboard

The **root** of the Admin Panel is located at `https://demo.teacherseat.com/section31` and this page is known as the Homepage Dashboard. 

The Homepage Dashboard will allow admin's to monitor various TeacherSeat resources at a glance and this Dashboard can be customized based admin's specific repsonsbilities.

## Finding Services

The Admin Panel is composed of various systems. To navigate to these systems an admin can access them form the Services dropdown in the header. If a particular systems cannot be found it is because an admin doesn't have permission to access that sysytem or the system is not registered for use in the learning platform.
