# Introduction to the Admin Panel

## What is the TeacherSeat Adminstrative Panel?

A **panel** is a web-application that represents a workspace for specific types of users within the TeacherSeat learning platform. A panel can also be referred to as a *console* or a *portal*.

The TeacherSeat platform is composed of two main panels:

1. The Student Panel — A web-application where students carry out studying
2. The Admin Panel — A web-application where administrators (admins) manage the various systems, content and users

When your TeacherSeat learning platform is provisioned and you log-in for the first time, you are accessing the Admin Panel.

From the Admin Panel you can perform various actions such as:
- install and register various systems and subsystems
- access and manager various TeacherSeat resources eg. users, materials, plans
- views analaytics of your other administrators
- view students progression through the provided learning materials


When users sign up to your learning platform, they are signing up as students and therefore will only have access to the Student Panel. Students generally do not have access to your Admin Panel but it is possible to configure a user to have both student and adminstrator panel access.
